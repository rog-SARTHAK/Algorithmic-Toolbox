# Algorithmic-Toolbox
Coursera Algorithmic Toolbox by University of California San Diego & National Research University Higher School of Economics.
I am publishing my work so that it can help people who are stuck in doing the respective assingments.
Please try not to just copy-paste the code.
This work is only for getting an idea. Even if you copy-paste, try to understand what is going on.
Thank You.
